# SOEN341-SA1
Website Project for SOEN 341 : Team SA1

### Team Members:
- Refat Kamal
- Ming Tao Yu

### Dev environment:
- Git/Github
- Local: XAMPP:
  - What is it: XAMPP is a free open source plateform that will turn your pc into a temporary local server capable of compiling PHP. It also provide you with a local mySQL database creation functionalities. 

  - Where to Download: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
  - How to run php with XAMPP https://www.techwalla.com/articles/how-to-run-a-php-file-in-xampp 
  - How to create a mySQL database with XAMPP: https://www.cloudways.com/blog/connect-mysql-with-php/ (copy past the .sql file in ourSOEN341 repo made specifically for the backend side of our website and execute it to create in XAMPP the tables)

- Remote cloud (Optional): AWS Elastic Beanstalk Application PHP server + MySQL database*. 
  - Sign up for a 12 month free account and read Issues -> TODO: Setup AWS environment for some useful links. 

- Text editor: Sublime Text 3, notepad++ or anything you feel comfortable writing codes in. It doesn't matter what text editors you use as the "compiler" will always be XAMPP

*Note that AWS is optional. You can start developing with just XAMPP + text editor + Git & not everyone needs to have an AWS account. I however recommend looking into AWS if cloud computing interests you.

HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL (alternative to PHP to be discussed, i.e. javascript + node.js)
