# SOEN341-SA1
Website Project for SOEN 341 : Team SA1

### Team Members:
- Refat Kamal
- Ming Tao Yu

### Dev environment:
- Git/Github
- Local: XAMPP (see issues tab -> TODO 4 for links on how to install). XAMPP will enable you to compile PHP. It also provide you with a local mySQL server. 
- Remote cloud: AWS Elastic Beanstalk Application PHP server + MySQL database*. 
- Text editor: Sublime Text 3, notepad++ or anything you feel comfortable writing codes in. 

*Note that AWS is optional. You can start developing with just XAMPP + text editor + Git & not everyone needs to have an AWS account. I however recommend looking into AWS if cloud computing interests you. 

### Main languages: 
HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL (alternative to PHP to be discussed, i.e. javascript + node.js) 

### Sprint 1 objectives:

Please see issue tab for comprehensive list

All team members needs to:
- Clone the master repo, create a new branch, add their name to the "Team Members" list in this Readme and make pull request to merge their changes to master repo. They then need to review someone else's pull request and approve the merge. 
- Setup dev environment with the softwares mentionned above
- Look into the "issue" section of the repo 

### Sprint 2 objectives:
- Read this tutorial: https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-phpmysql-powered-forum-from-scratch--net-10188
- Create the basic backbone of the Stackoverflow-like website before the 10th of December (Deadline is the 14th. However, this coincide with midterm week and should be avoided)
